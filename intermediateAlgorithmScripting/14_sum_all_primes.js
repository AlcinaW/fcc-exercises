// Sum all the prime numbers up to and including the provided number.

// A prime number is defined as a number greater than one and having only two divisors, one and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by one and two.

//create array with numbers between 1 and the final number (what if it is a large number?)
//how to check if prime?
//what if create array of already existing time and compare?
//or check each by dividing by numbers in from of it -> if divisible, move to next number because not prime

//SIEVE -> divide by certain key numbers -> divide by 2? remove all possibilities
